# Introduction to CSS Grid Layout
* The __CSS Grid Layout__ Module offers a grid-based layout system, with _rows_ and _columns_, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

# CSS Grid vs CSS Flexbox
* The main difference is that while __Flexbox__ helps with _one dimensional arrangement of elements_, __CSS grid__ is able to do _two dimensional arrangements_. i.e., __Flexbox__, allows you to either arrange elements _horizontally_ (in a row) or _vertically_ (in a column). But with __CSS Grid__ you can align elements both _vertically and horizontally_.
